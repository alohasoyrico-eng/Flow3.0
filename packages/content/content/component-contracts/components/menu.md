# Menu

Generated portable agent contract for Design System.

The JSON content remains the editable source of truth. Regenerate this file with `npm run build:component-contracts` after changing component copy.

Source content:

- `packages/content/content/component-copy/components/menu/all.json`

## Purpose

Use Menu for compact action sets attached to a trigger, especially when actions are contextual, secondary, grouped, or permission dependent.

## Definition Of Ready

Before building or changing this component, confirm:

- Design System owns naming, tokens, foundations, primitives, and public API.
- The reference ZIP may inform look and feel or motion, but every visual decision must translate back to Design System.
- Documentation, patterns, and templates must consume the package component or the official Package component registry.
- Docs CSS may arrange examples, but must not redefine component anatomy.

Foundations required: `Energy`, `Voice`, `Frame`, `Depth`, `Momentum`, `State`, `Tone`, `Growth`, `Symbol`, `Iconography`, `Accessibility`

Primitive dependencies: `Color`, `Typography`, `Spacing`, `Radius`, `Elevation`, `Iconography`, `Motion Curves`, `Duration`, `Breakpoints`, `Focus`, `Disabled`

Component dependencies: `None declared`

Token dependencies: `comp.menu.*`, `sys.energy.*`, `sys.frame.*`, `sys.voice.*`, `sys.depth.*`, `sys.momentum.*`, `sys.state.*`, `sys.accessibility.*`

Gaps or review gates:

- Forms in menu
- Hidden primary action
- Fake controls
- No keyboard close
- Raw visual values
- Ask before build: A menu item changes money, access, or legal state.
- Ask before build: The set needs more than a compact action list.
- Ask before build: The trigger is the only way to reach a primary action.

## Use When

- Use Menu for compact secondary action sets.
- Use separators when action risk or category changes.
- Escalate long or explanatory content to Drawer.

## Do Not Use Without Review

- Ask before use when a menu item changes money, access, or legal state.
- Ask before use when the set needs more than a compact action list.
- Ask before use when the trigger is the only way to reach a primary action.
- Menu contains forms, paragraphs, or complex filters.
- Danger actions are visually mixed with safe actions.
- Open, close, keyboard, or disabled behavior is undefined.
- Menu contains a form or rich content.
- Primary process action is hidden only in Menu.
- Items are not keyboard reachable.
- Trigger or items use fake buttons.
- Raw color, spacing, shadow, or motion values are used.

## Operational Example

Use Menu for compact action sets attached to a trigger, especially when actions are contextual, secondary, grouped, or permission dependent.

### Why Menu

- Menu keeps secondary actions near their object without turning every row into a toolbar.
- The ZIP reference defines the compact floating surface, item height, separators, hover state, and scale motion.
- Actions must be real buttons with menu semantics, not a visual list with fake affordances.

## Anatomy

| Part | Rule | Tokens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger | Opens the contextual action list and exposes expanded state. | comp.menu.*, sys.state.*, sys.accessibility.* |
| Panel | Floats near the trigger with radius, border, shadow, motion, and compact padding. | comp.menu.*, sys.depth.*, sys.frame.*, sys.momentum.* |
| Menu item | Uses clear labels, optional icons, disabled state, and keyboard focus. | sys.voice.*, sys.iconography.*, sys.state.* |
| Separator | Groups actions only when the group changes meaning or risk. | sys.frame.*, sys.energy.* |
| Danger item | Marks destructive action with semantic tone and hover surface. | sys.energy.*, sys.tone.* |

## Accessibility

State precedence: disabled, open, focus, default, closed

- Use a trigger with aria-haspopup menu and aria-expanded.
- Use role menu and menuitem for the floating panel and actions.
- Escape closes the menu and returns focus to the trigger.
- Disabled items remain visible only when they explain unavailable actions.
- Do not place long forms, filters, or rich content inside Menu.

## Foundations

Referenced token families:

- `comp.menu.*`
- `sys.accessibility.*`
- `sys.depth.*`
- `sys.energy.*`
- `sys.frame.*`
- `sys.iconography.*`
- `sys.momentum.*`
- `sys.state.*`
- `sys.tone.*`
- `sys.voice.*`

Menu API exposes trigger, items, variant, state, alignment, disabled state, avatar trigger metadata, danger tone, and separators while Design System foundations own surface, motion, keyboard, icon, and tone rules.

## Variants

Menu variants describe the action model: actions, grouped actions, selection commands, danger grouping, and icon-only trigger usage.

Approved variants from demos: `actions`, `grouped`, `selection`, `danger`, `icon-trigger`, `avatar-trigger`

Demo labels:

- Actions
- Grouped
- Selection
- Danger
- Icon trigger
- Account menu

## States

Menu states cover trigger availability, panel lifecycle, keyboard focus, disabled actions, and closed state.

Supported states from docs: `default`, `closed`, `open`, `focus`, `disabled`

## Variant X State Behavior

Variant sets action grouping; state defines whether the panel is available, open, focused, disabled, or closed.

State matrix: `open`, `focus`, `disabled`, `default`, `closed`

| Row | Demo variant | Demo state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actions | actions |  |
| Grouped | grouped |  |
| Danger | danger |  |

## Full Width

Menu belongs to its trigger, not the full page. The available region may be full-width, but the panel stays compact.

- Row action: layout: anchored compact
- Toolbar action: layout: anchored compact
- Closed trigger: layout: trigger only

## Responsive Layout Patterns

Menu stays compact across viewports. On phones, prefer fewer items and escalate long sets to Drawer or Bottom Sheet.

| Example | Layout | Density |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phone compact menu | simple-demo-row | lg |
| Desktop row menu | simple-demo-row | sm |

## Viewport Organization

Keep Menu near the object it controls. If the action set needs explanation, inputs, or review, use Drawer or Dialog.

| Viewport | Rule | Layout | Density |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phone | Use short menus only; escalate complex sets. | compact anchored | lg |
| Tablet | Keep panels within safe margins and away from nav. | anchored panel | md |
| Desktop | Use row or toolbar triggers for dense operations. | row action | sm |

## Playground

Use the playground to verify trigger label, variant, state, alignment, danger grouping, disabled items, and close behavior.

| Control | Type | Default | Options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| trigger | text | Actions |  |
| variant | select | actions | actions, grouped, selection, danger, icon-trigger, avatar-trigger |
| state | select | open | open, focus, disabled, default, closed |
| align | select | start | start, end |

## API And Foundations

Menu API exposes trigger, items, variant, state, alignment, disabled state, avatar trigger metadata, danger tone, and separators while Design System foundations own surface, motion, keyboard, icon, and tone rules.

| Name | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| triggerLabel | string | Yes | Menu trigger label. |
| items | MenuItem[] | Yes | Menu items. |
| open | boolean | No | Initial or controlled open state. |
| variant | actions \| grouped \| selection \| danger \| icon-trigger \| avatar-trigger | No | Action model shown by the menu. |
| density | sm \| md \| lg | No | Controls trigger, panel, and item scale for sm, md, and lg contexts. |
| state | default \| closed \| open \| focus \| disabled | No | Initial demo/component state. |
| align | start \| end | No | Panel alignment relative to the trigger. |
| label | string | No | Accessible menu label. |
| avatarName | string | No | Name rendered by Avatar when variant is avatar-trigger. |
| avatarStatus | none \| online \| busy \| offline | No | Avatar status rendered by the trigger when variant is avatar-trigger. |
| disabled | boolean | No | Disables the trigger. |
| onOpenChange | (open: boolean) => void | No | Called when local open state changes. |
| onSelect | (item: MenuItem) => void | No | Called when an item is selected. |

## Implementation Checklist

- Provide `triggerLabel`: Menu trigger label.
- Provide `items`: Menu items.
- aria-haspopup and aria-expanded
- role menu and menuitem
- Escape closes and restores focus
- Disabled items cannot activate
- Danger item contrast
- Panel clipping on small viewports

## Tests And Rejection Rules

Must test:

- aria-haspopup and aria-expanded
- role menu and menuitem
- Escape closes and restores focus
- Disabled items cannot activate
- Danger item contrast
- Panel clipping on small viewports

Reject if:

- Menu contains a form or rich content.
- Primary process action is hidden only in Menu.
- Items are not keyboard reachable.
- Trigger or items use fake buttons.
- Raw color, spacing, shadow, or motion values are used.

## MIEL

MIEL treats Menu as compact contextual action access: agents can use it for secondary commands while humans confirm item priority, destructive grouping, and whether a Drawer is more appropriate.

Agents can decide:

- Use Menu for compact secondary action sets.
- Use separators when action risk or category changes.
- Escalate long or explanatory content to Drawer.

Agents must ask:

- A menu item changes money, access, or legal state.
- The set needs more than a compact action list.
- The trigger is the only way to reach a primary action.

Agents must reject:

- Menu contains forms, paragraphs, or complex filters.
- Danger actions are visually mixed with safe actions.
- Open, close, keyboard, or disabled behavior is undefined.

Handoff language:

> I am using Menu for contextual secondary actions. Please confirm item order, destructive grouping, disabled behavior, alignment, and escalation rules.
